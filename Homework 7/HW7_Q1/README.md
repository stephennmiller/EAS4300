# EAS4300 â€“ HW7 Q1: Turbojet Performance Analysis

This repository contains code and outputs for analyzing a **non-afterburning turbojet** operating at 15 km altitude and Mach 1.8. The MATLAB script computes key performance parameters such as:
- Specific Thrust  
- Thrust-Specific Fuel Consumption (TSFC)  
- Thermal, Propulsive, and Overall Efficiencies  
- Nozzle Area Ratio  

and plots them against the **compressor pressure ratio** $\(r_c\)$.

## Files

1. **HW7_Q1.m**  
   Main MATLAB script that:
   - Calculates the performance parameters for a range of compressor pressure ratios.
   - Saves the computed results in a CSV file.
   - Produces four separate figures, each appended to **HW7_Q1_Plots.pdf**.

2. **HW7_Q1_Data.csv**  
   CSV file containing the computed data for each compressor pressure ratio.

3. **HW7_Q1_Plots.pdf**  
   A single PDF file with **four pages**, showing:
   - **Page 1:** Specific Thrust vs. $\(r_c\)$ 
   - **Page 2:** TSFC vs. $\(r_c\)$  
   - **Page 3:** Efficiencies $(\(\eta_{th}\), \(\eta_{p}\), \(\eta_{o}\)) vs. \(r_c\)$ 
   - **Page 4:** Nozzle Area Ratio vs. $\(r_c\)$

## Usage

1. Open **HW7_Q1.m** in MATLAB (R2020a or newer is recommended for multi-page PDF export).
2. Run the script.  
3. The script will:
   - Generate **HW7_Q1_Data.csv** with all the computed parameters.
   - Create **HW7_Q1_Plots.pdf**, which has one figure per page.

## Notes

- If you have an older MATLAB version (pre-R2020a), the `exportgraphics` function with `'Append'` may not work. In that case, you may need to install a third-party function (e.g., `append_pdfs`) or manually combine PDFs.
- The script uses **findpeaks** to label the local maxima of Specific Thrust.
- All parameters (efficiencies, TSFC, area ratio, etc.) are strictly for educational and illustrative purposes as part of EAS4300 coursework.
