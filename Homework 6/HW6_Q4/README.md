# HW6_Q4 - Ramjet Performance Sensitivity Study

## Purpose
This MATLAB script (`HW6_Q4.m`) is designed to solve a ramjet propulsion problem by conducting a sensitivity study of the ramjet engine's performance. The study evaluates the impact of combustor efficiency (\(\eta_b\)) and exhaust nozzle total pressure ratio (\(\pi_n\)) on thrust (\(I\)) and thrust-specific fuel consumption (TSFC) across a range of flight Mach numbers from 1 to 6. The code computes baseline performance metrics, perturbs the key parameters, calculates normalized sensitivity coefficients, generates plots, and saves the results to a `.csv` file and a `.pdf` figure for further analysis.

The problem is based on a scenario where the ramjet operates under specific ambient conditions and uses jet fuel with given properties. The script leverages finite difference approximations to derive sensitivity coefficients and visualizes the results in four plots, with Figure 1 (normalized sensitivity of thrust to \(\eta_b\)) automatically saved as a `.pdf` for inclusion in the GitHub repository.

## Problem Statements

### Problem 12
A ramjet is to propel an aircraft at Mach 3 at high altitude where the ambient pressure is 8.5 kPa and the ambient temperature \(T_0\) is 220 K. The turbine inlet temperature \(T_t\) is 2540 K.
- a. The thermal efficiency,
- b. The propulsion efficiency,
- c. The overall efficiency.
Assume all components of the engine are ideal—that is, frictionless—determine the above efficiencies. The specific heat ratio by \(\gamma = 1.4\) and make the approximations appropriate to \(f \ll 1\).

### Problem 4
(15 points) Conduct a sensitivity study of the performance of the ramjet engine with respect to combustion efficiency \(\eta_b\) and the exhaust nozzle total pressure ratio \(\pi_n\). Using the conditions and properties listed for problem 12 as a starting point and jet fuel used has a heat of combustion of 43,000 kJ/kg, and a stoichiometric fuel to air ratio of 0.06, construct plots of

\[
\frac{d(I)}{d\eta_b}, \quad \frac{d(I)}{d\pi_n}, \quad \frac{d(\text{TSFC})}{d\eta_b}, \quad \frac{d(\text{TSFC})}{d\pi_n},
\]

as a function of flight Mach number from 1 to 6. The derivatives can be approximated using small but discrete changes, such as

\[
\frac{d(I)}{d\eta_b} \approx \frac{\Delta I}{\Delta \eta_b}.
\]

Use baseline \(\eta_b\) and \(\pi_n\) values of one, and use delta values of 0.01. Make plots of the normalized sensitivity coefficient (e.g., derivative) as a function of flight Mach number:

1. \(\frac{1}{I} \frac{dI}{d\eta_b}\) vs. \(M_{\text{flight}}\)
2. \(\frac{1}{I} \frac{dI}{d\pi_n}\) vs. \(M_{\text{flight}}\)
3. \(\frac{1}{\text{TSFC}} \frac{d(\text{TSFC})}{d\eta_b}\) vs. \(M_{\text{flight}}\)
4. \(\frac{1}{\text{TSFC}} \frac{d(\text{TSFC})}{d\pi_n}\) vs. \(M_{\text{flight}}\)

(15 points) Conduct a sensitivity study with respect to the performance of the ramjet engine with respect to combustion efficiency \(\eta_b\) and the exhaust nozzle total pressure ratio \(\pi_n\).

## Files

- **HW6_Q4.m**: The main MATLAB script that performs the calculations, generates plots, and saves the results.
- **HW6_Q4_results.csv**: Contains the computed data including Mach number, thrust (\(I\)), TSFC, and normalized sensitivity coefficients. [Download HW6_Q4_results.csv](HW6_Q4_results.csv)
- **HW6_Q4_Figure1.pdf**: The first figure showing the normalized sensitivity of thrust to \(\eta_b\) (\(\frac{1}{I} \frac{dI}{d\eta_b}\)) vs. flight Mach number, automatically generated by the script. [Download HW6_Q4_Figure1.pdf](HW6_Q4_Figure1.pdf)

## How to Use
1. **Run the Script**: Execute `HW6_Q4.m` in MATLAB to perform the calculations, generate the plots, and save the `.csv` and `.pdf` files.
2. **Access Data**: The script automatically generates `HW6_Q4_results.csv` and `HW6_Q4_Figure1.pdf` in the working directory, which can be opened in any spreadsheet software or viewed with a PDF reader.
3. **Analysis**: Use the `.csv` file and `.pdf` figure for reporting or additional analysis (e.g., with an AI tool like Grok 3 for trend identification).

## Notes
- The script assumes ideal components (\(\eta_b = 1\), \(\pi_n = 1\)) as a baseline, with perturbations of \(\Delta = 0.01\).
- The fuel-to-air ratio (\(f = 0.06\)) and heat of combustion (\(43,000 \, \text{kJ/kg}\)) are used as specified.
- The plots and data reflect the sensitivity study as required, with trends analyzed to guide ramjet design optimizations (e.g., prioritizing \(\eta_b\) at high Mach numbers).
